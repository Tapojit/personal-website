				<h2><u>Division II Retrospective Essay</u></h2>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					Despite passing Division I after coming back on Fall 2016, I believe my Division II officially began once I
					landed in China for my Intensive Summer Mandarin program. A rigorous class schedule of five days a
					week, coupled with two tutoring sessions often felt taxing. But it was worth it; I finished the entire
					intermediate Mandarin level in eight weeks, which generally takes an entire college year. My tutors,
					who were students of the college where I studied Chinese, were amazing guides to life in modern China.
					Perhaps the most humbling story they told me is about how families in smaller towns and villages
					circumvented the one-child policy. Many children got adopted by close family relatives and these
					children could meet their biological parents only on social events, such as marriages of biological
					siblings.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					Besides learning Mandarin, as part of my grant program, I carried out a survey amongst the students of
					the college about their perspective on food security in China and how their diet is impacted. My tutors
					helped me to translate the surveys, based on which I wrote an essay. It also addresses how Chinese food
					security impacts the global food supply.

					Throughout my Division II, I have been concentrating on machine learning and linguistics. The
					experiences I have gained on these two concentrations in my last two years is essential for my future
					Division III, which will be in the area of Natural Language Processing.


				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					My Division II strategy was to take mostly 300+ level five college courses in order to familiarize myself with the higher-level concepts as early as possible. I did this with the anticipation that, the sooner I get to learn them, the sooner I can experiment/build upon them in future independent studies. Hence, I avoided taking lower-level prerequisites and took courses which I believed would give me the necessary tools to work with in the future.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					In Fall 2016, I took the second part of Data Structures in Amherst. This is when I gained confidence in my coding abilities, as I consistently scored above 90% in the assignments. However, I did not fare that well in the written exams; eventually leaving with a B-. The statistics class I took is my first math class in college. It was one of the more relaxed classes that semester. In case of Language with Time and Intro to Psych, average performance in exams landed me two B’s.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					2017 Spring was my most productive, as well as my most stressful semester. Besides taking five classes, an independent study and an audited course, I also worked on building Android and iOS apps for the Hampshire’s Hackathon event (HampHack). I started working on them from 2016 Winter break and finished right before the event in late March 2017.

				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					Moreover, I also headed a team of Hampshire students who came up with their own tech installations for the event to inspire incoming hackathon participants. In the end, we came up with two installations: our own DIY game console built using a raspberry pi and a “style transfer mirror” which uses deep learning to manipulate camera feed in an artistic manner.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					In case of the independent study, I worked under Ethan Meyers with two other students on setting up a bottom-up visual search psychophysics experiment. The experiment involved showing a given participant a series of visual stimuli, based on which they were required to press certain keys. Based on key presses, their reaction times were determined and whether they pressed the right key. I used a python package called Psychopy to build a pipeline which displayed the stimuli, recorded participant response and reaction times.

				<p class="word-wrap">
					I took my first graduate-level class in UMASS on Machine Learning, which was instrumental in introducing me to the algorithms most commonly used in the industry and taught me how to come up with my own algorithms. To strengthen my machine learning base, I also took Linear Algebra. Moreover, I also got around to learn parallelizing tasks and how to work with cloud compute during one of my distributed ML assignments. My toughest course that semester was on Philosophy of Language, for which I had to write some of my longest papers. It covered multiple topics on Linguistics, from Frege to Kripke. This is also the course where I got interested in Pragmatics after I was introduced to Grice. The constant drilling in the semantics course in the form of regular homeworks and T.A. hours helped me to work on derivations with few hitches.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					I think my only regret is squeezing advanced Mandarin into such a tight schedule. Initially, I wanted to take it just for the sake of “getting done” with all the levels, but I feel I could have retained more of what I was taught if I took it later. The only class I audited was Genetic Programming; it gave me access to the course materials without being committed to come on a regular basis. The materials and the drop-ins were essential in recalling what I learnt about Clojure in my Div I and to learn GP during my break.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					During the summer, I worked under Ethan at MIT, where I compared Neural data of Primates with image recognition convolutional neural nets (CNNs). This was my first opportunity to work on an independent project involving machine learning. I also had to carry out multiple statistical analyses and data visualization.

				<p class="word-wrap">
					Throughout my first year of Div II, I have taken sufficient courses on computer science/machine learning and linguistics to strengthen my skill bases on these subjects. In the second year, my goal was to incorporate these skills into more interdisciplinary projects. That’s why I was very excited to take my Natural Language Processing class in Fall 2017. This is where I got to apply the linguistics theory I learnt to develop machine learning algorithms to parse text-based datasets, such as twitter data. For the finals, I got to work on a project with two other grad students, where we carried out deep feature extraction of tweets to predict their emotional intensity using multi-layer neural nets.

					I also worked as a Teaching Assistant for Professor Lee Spector’s class on Artificial Intelligence; the very first course I took with him. I enjoyed helping the students out with their projects and getting to know about their opinions on the prevalence of A.I today. I also did a small presentation on Neural Nets and an introduction to building them using a Clojure-based library called Cortex. For the presentation, I built and showcased a cat-dog image CNN classifier.

				<p class="word-wrap">
					My growing interest in pragmatics led me to take a class on it. Initially, I thought we were going to dive deeper into Gricean theories, but pragmatics was so much more than that. We tackled discourse coherence theory for majority of the semester, which mostly involved drawing up discourse graphs. It was frustrating at times for me, as almost everyone in the class came up with different graphs for a given discourse. What’s most frustrating was most of their reasoning made sense. This frustration was in part responsible for influencing me to do an independents study on this topic in the next semester. However, discourse coherence theory is an exciting topic for me, as it is relatively new in the field of linguistics and it sounds promising for NLP tasks like text summarization and agent-based sentiment analysis.

					Over at Mt. Holyoke, I enjoyed my “Embodied interaction” class, where we had to work with Kinect to make interactive computer art. Our assignments and finals were all projects instead of exams, where we worked in teams. I did three projects in total for the class, but I felt I was doing most of the work for all of them.

					My numerical analysis class had a steep learning curve for me (maybe because it was for fourth year students and I did not take any prerequisites). In the first day, we had a quiz and my inability to answer most of them prompted my professor to ask me to reconsider taking the class. However, the programming component of the class helped me to familiarize myself with the concepts being taught in class.

					This semester was all about using what I have learnt till now to work on independent studies closely related to my Division III project. Hence, with my committee chair’s advice, I took only one course and two independent studies.

				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					I took Game Theory at UMASS knowing that it will not require too much of my effort. Nevertheless, it was a fun and stress-free course as most of my homeworks were math-based problems.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					The independent studies were my two most challenging endeavors. I worked on discourse graph parsing from discourses in texts under my chair Daniel Altshuler. Initially, I had to do a lot of hopping around when it came to finding the most appropriate text corpus. Some were kept behind a paywall, whereas others had little to no documentation describing the corpus. I finally started working on a corpus of chat data called STAC (STrAtegic Conversations). I was able to fulfill two of my three objectives, but the final one, which involved coming up with a machine learning algorithm for parsing, was unsuccessful. A crucial set of features were not present in the corpus, so I emailed the team who compiled the corpus. They are yet to reply to my emails. Nevertheless, this independent study helped me to learn in depth about discourse coherence and get rid of my misconceptions concerning it. I also got to know about NLP projects currently working in this area.

				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					In my second independent study, I have been working with two other students under my committee member Lee Spector. It is called TUSH, a variant of Lee’s push programming language written in python. The main purpose of TUSH is to dynamically create classification computation graphs from training data using evolutionary genetic programming (GP). I have been working on GP algorithms which generate and determine the most optimized computation graph. We have started testing last month and have been coming up with new parameters to limit the evolutionary search space. We will be working on this project over the summer.

				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					Since last semester, I have been working on a web platform with a couple of my friends. It is called Teamwerk, where college students can post their collaborative projects to get team members with specific skill sets on board. I have been working on building and maintaining the website, which took up a considerable amount of my time this semester.
				</p>
				<p class="word-wrap">
					Overall, I think taking higher-level courses early on did pay off well for me. Not only did I get to learn more in a shorter time, my grades also improved with time. For my Division III, I would like to work on agent-based sentiment analysis of text via discourse parsing. Moreover, I would also like to look into whether it is possible to influence decision making of Neural Nets trained to predict future stock prices using agent-based sentiment scores from financial newspapers.
